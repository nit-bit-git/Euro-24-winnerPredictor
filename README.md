## 🌟 **Key Features**

- **Data Scraping**: Automated collection of football data from [fbref.com](https://fbref.com).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Transformation and cleaning of raw data to make it suitable for model training.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Utilized for its robustness and accuracy in classification tasks.
- **High Precision**: Achieved an impressive precision score of **0.90**, indicating reliable predictions.

## 📊 **How It Works**

- **Data Collection**:
  - We scraped comprehensive football data from [fbref.com](https://fbref.com) to gather relevant statistics and features.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned and transformed the raw data, handling missing values and normalizing features to prepare it for modeling.

- **Model Training**:
  - Implemented a Random Forest Classifier to train on the preprocessed data. The Random Forest model was chosen for its ability to handle complex patterns and interactions in the data.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Evaluated the model using precision, achieving a score of **0.90**, which reflects its effectiveness in predicting match outcomes and potential winners.

## 📈 **Results**

<p align="center">
  The Random Forest Classifier has been tested on the data, achieving a precision score of **0.90**. This suggests the model has a high level of accuracy in predicting the outcomes, but further development is needed to finalize the model.
